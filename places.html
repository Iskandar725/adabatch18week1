<p><strong>Petaling Jaya</strong>(commonly called "PJ" by locals) is a major Malaysian city originally developed as a <strong>satellite township</strong> for Kuala Lumpur. It is located in the <em>Petaling</em> District of Selangor with an area of approximately 97.2 square kilometres (37.5 sq mi). Petaling Jaya was granted city status on 20 June 2006.</p>
<p>Petaling Jaya is <em>surrounded</em> by the Malaysian capital, <strong>Kuala Lumpur</strong> to the east, <strong>Sungai Buloh</strong> to the north, <strong>Shah Alam</strong>, the capital of Selangor and <strong>Subang Jaya</strong> to the west and <strong>Bandar Kinrara</strong>(Puchong) to the south.</p>
<p>Just <em>25 minutes</em> from the heart of Kuala Lumpur, Petaling Jaya is famous for shopping with more than 12 <em>major</em> malls within its retail landscape – that’s pretty <em>impressive</em> for an area less than half the size of KL. Well connected by light rail transit (LRT) train links, the Petaling Jaya shopping scene certainly takes it to an altogether different level. Here, you will find <strong>1 Utama</strong>, the world’s fifth largest mall, home to over 650 stores, with brands like <em>Bershka, Morgan de Toii</em> and <em>Coach</em> represented. Fun for the whole family, there is an indoor rock climbing gym, the <em>largest</em> rooftop garden in <em>Southeast Asia</em>, a gaming arcade, 13-screen theatre, and 36-lane bowling alley in this centre.</p>
<p>A busy shopping neighbourhood, if that is not enough the fun of shopping in Petaling Jaya doesn’t stop there. About 30 minutes from KL is the <em>Egyptian-themed</em> <strong>Sunway Pyramid mall</strong> in Bandar Sunway, which is set next door to a water theme park, and houses an indoor ice skating rink. Meanwhile, both Amcorp Mall, and The Curve in Kota Damansara have seriously awesome weekend outdoor flea markets, where you can find antique furniture, cool collectibles and even vintage finds.</p>
